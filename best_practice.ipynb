    "- It's a good idea to keep your main branch as the stable/working branch\n",
    "- Make changes in small increments; this makes it easier to merge branches back into main\n",

Docstrings are better for mature projects when functions won't change often. The issue is that as the code of a function changes the documentation may begin to not reflect the actual behavior of the function (this is called documentation drift). The compiler or your tests will complain at you if your code has a bug, but no error will be raised if your documentation doesn't match the function behavior. LLMs are making this less of an issue by speeding up the documentation process."
